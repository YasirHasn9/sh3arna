## sh3arna

Sh3arna is a compassionate and innovative app designed to bridge the gap between generosity and need during religious occasions.
It serves as a platform for individuals of faith to share their blessings by distributing food to the less fortunate and to the community at large.
By allowing users to pinpoint their location and announce the time and place of food distribution, Sh3arna makes it easier for those in need to find nourishment and support.
Whether you're looking to give or receive, Sh3arna connects you with nearby opportunities within a 10-20 mile radius, fostering a sense of unity and care in the community.
Join us in spreading kindness and fulfilling the needs of those around us through the simple act of sharing a meal.
