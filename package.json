  "description": "Setup a Node/Typescript production ready project. Hi, my name is Yasir, I'am a full-stack developer(more focus on the backend), working with mainly in Asp.net(C#) for my company Oxe.fit. The last time I started a project from scratch to the end was almost 15 months ago. So I missed that. And I was waiting for a reason(an idea) to start one. and couple of days ago, on the weekend, I decided to delete unnecessary repositories on GitHub, I deleted some and it felt like a tedious process to visit every repository and go to the settings and following all the steps to delete one (kill me). Then struck me, what if I build a cli command to delete multiple repositories at once. holla, I found the reason. I googled I found it already built years ago, and I thought it was original, I got a little upset, but I said to myself, so what, let me start build one and then use the already built-ones as reference if I needed help.",
